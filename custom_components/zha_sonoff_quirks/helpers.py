"""Entity-registry resolution helpers shared by services, run log and sensors.

Everything here resolves entities by registry unique_id, never by entity_id:
users rename entity_ids freely, but unique_ids are stable. The quirk entities
get unique_id = f"{ieee}-{endpoint}-{unique_id_suffix}"; the channel switches
are plain zha OnOff entities with unique_id "<ieee>-<endpoint>" or
"<ieee>-<endpoint>-6" depending on the endpoint's Zigbee device_type.
