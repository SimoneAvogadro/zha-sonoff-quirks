"""Device-centric irrigation services for the SONOFF SWV-ZF2 water valve.

The quirk (see ``quirks/sonoff_swv_zf2.py``) exposes the valve's irrigation
configuration as plain HA entities: a mode select, target number entities
(duration in minutes / volume in liters), a fail-safe number, and one On/Off
switch per channel. Starting a volume- or time-limited run therefore means
"write the config entities, then flip the channel switch" — the valve firmware
reads the (global, endpoint-1) config when a channel opens and closes the
channel by itself once the target is reached.

The services registered here bundle that multi-entity sequence into a single
device-centric call so cards and automations don't have to know the entity
layout:

    zha_sonoff_quirks.irrigation_by_liters(target | device_id, channel, liters,
                                           fail_safe_minutes?)
    zha_sonoff_quirks.irrigation_by_minutes(target | device_id, channel, minutes,
                                            fail_safe_minutes?)

The valve is addressed by a standard HA service *target* (`services.yaml`
declares ``target:``), which is what makes the two services show up in the
automation editor's "by target" tab when the valve device is selected — device
actions cannot do that since HA 2026.8 (see TODO #12). HA merges the target
into ``call.data`` before validation, so ``device_id`` / ``entity_id`` /
``area_id`` / ``floor_id`` / ``label_id`` are plain data fields here, and an
automation saved before the target existed (``data: {device_id: …}``) keeps
working unchanged. The target only picks the DEVICE; ``channel`` stays the
one and only way to choose the line.

``services.yaml`` is static, but the line radio can still show the names the
user gave the lines (the ``text`` line-name entities, stored in the config
entry options): ``async_publish_service_descriptions`` rewrites the two
service descriptions at runtime through ``async_set_service_schema``, with
``A — Giardino`` style option labels, and ``async_refresh_service_descriptions``
re-registers the services afterwards so the frontend (which refetches all
service descriptions a few seconds after a ``service_registered`` event) picks
the new labels up without a page reload. Labels are only possible while
exactly ONE SWV valve is registered: the form does not know which device the
target holds, and one label set must fit every valve.

There is deliberately no server-side timer or monitoring task: the SWV-ZF2
auto-closes on-device, so once the switch is on the job is done. Stopping a
run early is a plain ``switch.turn_off`` on the channel switch.
